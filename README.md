## General info

A react app which allows users to search for tracks, albums or artists via the Spotify API, and create / add new playlists to their Spotify account. The project was completed as part of my codecademy course and is my first semi-complex react project.

Users are able to search for media, create / add new playlists, providing they have a spotify account. The spotify API will redirect users on their first search and authenticate, then allow queries or updates.
